// A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
// The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
// Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
//
// An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
//
// Note: m and n will be at most 100.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input:
// [
//   [0,0,0],
//   [0,1,0],
//   [0,0,0]
// ]
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
// There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
// 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
// 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
