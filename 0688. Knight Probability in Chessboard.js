// On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th x and c-th column and attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
// A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.
// Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
// The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.
//
// Example:
//
// Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
// Output: 0.0625
// Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
// From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
// The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.
//
// Note:
//
// N will be between 1 and 25.
// K will be between 0 and 100.
// The knight always initially starts on the board.
