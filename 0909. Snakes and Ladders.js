// On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:
//
// 36 35 34 33 32 31
// 25 26 27 28 29 30
// 24 23 22 21 20 19
// 12 14 15 16 17 18
// 12 11 10  9  8  7
//  1  2  3  4  5  6
//
// You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square x, consists of the following:
//
// - You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.
// (This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)
// - If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.
//
// A board square on row r and column c has a "snake or ladder" if board[r][c] != -1.  The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].
// Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)
// Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return -1.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: [
// [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
// [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
// [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
// [-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
// [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
// [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation:
// At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].
// You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.
// You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.
// You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.
// You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.
// It can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.
//
// Note:
//
// 2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20
// board[i][j] is between 1 and N*N or is equal to -1.
// The board square with number 1 has no snake or ladder.
// The board square with number N*N has no snake or ladder.
