// Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

// Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

// Since we do not have access to the node before the one we want to delete, we cannot modify the next pointer of that node in any way.
// Instead, we have to replace the value of the node we want to delete with the value in the node after it, and then delete the node after it.
// Because we know that the node we want to delete is not the tail of the list, we can guarantee that this approach is possible.
