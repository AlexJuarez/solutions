// Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
//
// Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
//
// Example:
//
// Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

// Time O(n). Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while loop nested within the for loop,
//   closer inspection reveals it to be linear. Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks the
//   beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in nums), the while loop can only run for n iterations
//   throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the
//   nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n) time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall
//   runtime is linear.
//
// Space O(n). In order to set up O(1) containment lookups, we allocate linear space for a hash table to store the
//   O(n) numbers in nums. Other than that, the space complexity is identical to that of the brute force solution.
//
// It turns out that our initial brute force solution was on the right track, but missing a few optimizations
// necessary to reach O(n) time complexity.
//
// This optimized algorithm contains only two changes from the brute force approach: the numbers are stored in a
// HashSet (or Set, in Python) to allow O(1) lookups, and we only attempt to build sequences from numbers that are
// not already part of a longer sequence. This is accomplished by first ensuring that the number that would
// immediately precede the current number in a sequence is not present, as that number would necessarily be part
// of a longer sequence.
